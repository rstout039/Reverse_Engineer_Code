# reverseEngineerCode
For this project I reverse engineered a piece of code.<br>
Using that code, I explained a step-by-step walkthrough of how the codebase works and what you have to do to produce the desired content from the code.<br>
When the user follows the walkthrough, then the user will understand how the codebase works.<br>
This app used the following packages:<br>
# sequelize <br> passport <br> mySQL2 <br> express <br> express-session <br> bycryptjs <br> passport-local
This app's walkthrough is off of Google Docs. <br>
The apps walkthrough has a table of contents page where the user knows exactly the layout of the walkthrough.<br>
